# Connex One Tech Test - Client

This is my Connex One Full Stack Developer Technical Test Frontend repo.

It is built in React (w/ TypeScript) to achieve what was set out in the requirements.

The server/backend part of this project can be found here: https://github.com/Jlh77/connex-one-tech-test-server

## Setup

(This will check the projects .nvmrc for which version to use automatically)
